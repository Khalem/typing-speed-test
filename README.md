# Typing Speed Test - Built with React

## Why?

I enjoy typing speed tests and often like to do a few before I even begin coding to warm the hands up a little. I thought
it would be a great project to try build with React. 

## Inspiration

I was heavily inspired by [Typing-Speed-Test-AOEU](https://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu/). I use their website a lot
and really like how simple and clear the words were to type. So I decided to build something similar.

## General Thoughts

I decided to go with a npm package called random-word to generate the words for me. This made things easier, but the words are
more awkward to type than I'd like. Maybe I could write some more code to generate easier words to type for a better overall experience.

This was the second time I used framer-motion for animations. I'm starting to get the hang of it and I'd really like to do something more advanced in my next project.

## Things to add

I wasn't sure if these would be necessary so I might just add them in the future. 
- Light mode
- Leaderboards using Firebase
- Track progress
- Display how the user averages against other users scores
